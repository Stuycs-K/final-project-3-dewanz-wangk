# Presentation
## Bash Overview
Before we talk about the shellshock exploit, lets have a quick refresher about bash
### Variables

Bash treats everything as a string by default. You can access variables by appending '$' in front of a variable name
```bash
foo=bar
echo $foo
# bar

foo="bar"
echo $foo
# bar
```

However, any strings with spaces need quotes for proper assignment
```bash
foo=bar bar
# bar: command not found

foo="bar bar"
echo $foo
"bar bar"
```

### Environment Variables
Environment variables store data used by the operating system and other programs. When you open a new shell session, these pre-defined variables will be ready for your use. 

For example, `$HOME` contains your home directory, `$PATH` is the list of directories that programs have access to, etc.


### The `env` command
`env` is a command that allows you to manipulate environment variables. One way `env` can be used is to set environment variables for commands:
```bash
$ env foo=bar printenv 
HOSTTYPE=x86_64
LANG=C.UTF-8
PATH=/home/alice:/usr/local/bin
TERM=xterm-256color
HOME=/home/alice
USER=alice
LOGNAME=alice
SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
foo=bar
```
Here we run `printenv`, which prints all environment variables, after using `env` to make a new environment variable `foo` that equals `bar`, which appears in the `printenv` output as expected.

### Function Declaration
```bash
function x {
    echo "hello world"
}
x () {
    echo "hello world"
}

x () { echo "hello world" ; }

x='() { echo "hello world"; }'
```
These four function declarations are equivalent, though the last one is only valid for older versions of bash.

## Shellshock
Shellshock is a series of 6 exploits that all take advantage of the bash parser to cause unintended code execution. They affect bash versions 1.03 to 4.3, which is 25 years of bashs since 1989!

The exploit looks something like this:

```bash
env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"
```
This command runs `echo this is a test` on a new instant of bash with an environment variable `x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable'`. The first part of the variable definition, `() { :;}`, declares an empty function, and the function declaration is followed by a newline and extra code, `echo vulnerable`.

If your system prints `vulnerable` in addition to `this is a test`, that means you are susceptible to a shellshock attack. This occurs because in older versions of bash, the variable parser would convert any functions defined as variables into code blocks and execute them.

In this case, `x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable'` would be converted by the bash parser into `x () { : ; }; echo vulnerable`, and then execute this line of code. The problem is, bash interprets `;` as a newline, which means it will also execute the code following the function declaration.

For very, very obvious reasons, this is incredibly bad.

## Attack Vector 0: OpenSSH RCE
SSH (Secure Shell) is a service that allows user to securely access a shell on a remote computer. Typically, it is good security practice to only grant services the minimum required permissions. 

Instead of allowing a service to execute arbitrary commands over SSH, a "Forced Command" can be used to restrict a user to only executing one command. When a Forced Command is specified, this user should not be able to execute any other commands.

### Conditions for Exploit
0. Victim's bash version must be of a known vulnerable version (through 4.3)
1. The adversary should be able to control the environment variables being passed
2. A new subprocess/bash shell must be spawned

### Walkthrough
To begin our exploit, we will first examine the behavior of environment variables in BASH to see how we can manipulate the ability in BASH to save functions as environment vars.

To test for whether your system is vulnerable, you can run the following line, which stores a function consisting of two echoes and a bash call as an environment variable `x`.
```bash
$env x= ‘() { :;}; echo shellshocked’ bash –c “echo vulnerable”
```
If your bash shell prints out `shellshocked` and `vulnerable`, then uh-oh!

In addition, OpenSSH has a “ForceCommand” feature, where a fixed command is executed when the user logs in, instead of just running an unrestricted command shell. The fixed command is executed even if the user specified that another command should be run.

Now that we've confirmed the target system is vulnerable, let's get started with the exploit!
