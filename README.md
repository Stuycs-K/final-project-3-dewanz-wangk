# 3.ShellShock Attack

## Project Description
The shellshock vulnerability is a remote command excution vulnerabiltiy identified in BASH. To leverage this vulnerabiltiy in executing an exploit targetting . Because BASH may incorrectly execute trailing commands as interpretation does not end , our demonstration and lab will illustrate various attack vectors involving passing environment variables into BASH such that the adversary may execute commands with higher privilege requirements.
